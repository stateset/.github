### What we do

StateSet builds AI‑native agents and an iCommerce Engine that run day‑to‑day operations end‑to‑end—orders, returns, subscriptions, fulfillment, and CX—across your entire stack.  
We focus on **outcomes over clicks**: fewer tools, fewer tickets, lower costs, happier customers.

**Why teams choose StateSet**

- **Autonomous agents for CX & ops** — Resolve tickets, update orders, manage subscriptions, and trigger workflows across connected systems.
- **Unified engine** — One integration layer and data model; deterministic workflows (Temporal) with AI on top.
- **Predictable pricing** — Outcome‑focused, **no per‑automation / per‑interaction** usage tax.
- **Fast go‑live** — Implemented by our team, measured in weeks—not quarters. **BFCM & peak‑ready.**
- **Enterprise security** — SOC 2 Type I and modern best practices.
